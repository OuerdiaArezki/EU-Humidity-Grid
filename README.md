This repository contains relative humidity data extracted from the Copernicus E-OBS v31.0e gridded meteorological dataset at 0.1° spatial resolution.
The original E-OBS product provides daily fields over the full European grid, composed of 705 longitudes × 465 latitudes, covering the period 1950–2025.

From this continental domain, a fully observed 100 × 60 rectangular region was selected, corresponding to a well-covered part of Western and Central Europe (including eastern France, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, western Germany, and northern Switzerland).
The dataset provided here includes a snapshot of relative humidity for 2003-08-01, extracted without missing values and formatted for use in spatial and spatiotemporal modelling (e.g., 2D-RCAR models).
